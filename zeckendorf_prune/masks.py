"""
Zeckendorf-constrained mask generation.

The adjacency constraint: no two consecutive positions may both be active.
This is the same (1,∞)-RLL constraint that governs Fibonacci coding,
CSD arithmetic, and the golden mean shift. Capacity: log₂(φ) ≈ 0.694
bits per position, guaranteeing ≤50% density.

Mask selection uses dynamic programming to find the maximum-weight
independent set under the adjacency constraint — the optimal subset
of weights to keep, given their magnitudes.

two_four_mask builds the 2-of-4 baseline the constraint is compared against.
